## Introduction

As a kid i've always wanted to be an austronaut cause i wanted the see the whole universum, but now im enjoying to meet the LINUX Arch universum and i need to say its reallyyyyy interesting.
The config has a austronaut like theme and isnt as configured as others but i like it simple and want to share it with you guys.

## I'm using

- shell: zsh
- terminal: kitty
- multiplexer: tmux
- wayland: hyprland
- theme: GTK3 (icons same)
- editor: nvim (like a boss)
- explorer: normal vim explorer (idk why but i hate oil)
- waybar: waybar xd
- hyprpaper,wlogout,....

### thats how it looks :)
