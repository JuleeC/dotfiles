As a kid i've always wanted to be an austronaut cause i wanted the see the whole universum, but now im enjoying to meet the LINUX Arch universum and i need to say its reallyyyyy interesting.
The config has a austronaut like theme and isnt as configured as others but i like it simple and want to share it with you guys.

I'm using:
* shell: zsh
* terminal: kitty
* multiplexer: tmux
* wayland: hyprland
* theme: GTK3 (icons same)
* editor: nvim (like a boss)
* explorer: normal vim explorer (idk why but i hate oil)
* waybar: waybar xd
* hyprpaper,wlogout,....
